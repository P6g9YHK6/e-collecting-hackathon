# E-Collecting Hackathon
At the Federal Chancellery's E-Collecting Hackathon (October 31 and November 1, 2025, in Bern), we are designing and developing solutions for collecting electronic signatures for popular initiatives and referendums. Meet developers, experts, and interested parties from government, politics, academia, and civil society, and play an active role in shaping e-collecting.
