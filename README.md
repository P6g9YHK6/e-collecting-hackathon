# E-Collecting Hackathon
At the Federal Chancellery's [E-Collecting](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting.html) [Hackathon](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/aktuelles.html) (October 31 and November 1, 2025, in Bern), we are designing and developing solutions for collecting electronic signatures for popular initiatives and referendums from A to Z. Meet developers, experts, and interested parties from government, politics, academia, and civil society, and play an active role in shaping e-collecting. [Register now!](https://findmind.ch/c/hackathon-registration)

Over the course of two days, you will develop your solutions, addressing the 10 topics outlined in the [guidelines](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/aktuelles.html). You will work in teams taking different approaches to said topics. You can develop a conceptual, clickable, and/or technical prototype. Either way, you should clearly present the interactions and data flows between actors, software, and infrastructure components over time, as well as the user experience of these actors.

Together, you will contribute to comparing different ways of how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. As part of the [participatory process](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/partizipativer_prozess.html), your solutions will be discussed in subsequent workshops and will possibly be taken into account for the official decision on the design of the federal e-collecting trials. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated.
