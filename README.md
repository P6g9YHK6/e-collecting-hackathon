# E-Collecting Hackathon
At the Federal Chancellery's E-Collecting Hackathon (October 31 and November 1, 2025, in Bern), we are designing and developing solutions for collecting electronic signatures for popular initiatives and referendums from A to Z. Meet developers, experts, and interested parties from government, politics, academia, and civil society, and play an active role in shaping e-collecting.

Over the course of two days, you will develop your solution addressing the topics outlined in the white paper **(add link to updated version)**. Your solution can be a concept, a clickable or a technical prototype. In any case, you should clearly present the interactions and data flows between the actors, software and infrastructure components over time as well as the user experience of the actors. 

Together, you will contribute to comparing different ways of how to implement e-collecting in Switzerland. As part of the [participatory process](https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/de/home/politische-rechte/e-collecting/partizipativer_prozess.html), your solutions will be discussed in subsequent workshops and will ultimately be taken into account for the official decision on which option to pursue as a pilot. Proper documentation is key to ensuring that your solution can be understood and evaluated.
